# Tortured Earth Role Playing Game

Tortured Earth (TE) is a class-less, level-less role playing game set in an apocalyptic future. The system is designed to allow the transition of characters among science fiction, fantasy and horror settings in a seamless manner without loss of skills, assigned points, or equipment. Without the restriction of class, players are free to create unique custom characters without overpowering or under mining the established story board.
